#Project: Deploy Node.js with MySQL DB Backend using Docker Compose

The goal of the project is to deploy a Node.js application that interacts with a MySQL database using Docker. You will create Docker images for both the Node.js app and the MySQL database, and use Docker Compose to orchestrate the containers.

We will perform the foolowing in this project:

#Step 1: Containerize Node.js App using a Dockerfile (Multi-staged & Cache Layered)
Objective: Create a Dockerfile to containerize a Node.js application. The application will be packaged with all its dependencies, and a production-ready image will be built.

#Step 2: Persist Node.js App Data with MySQL DB Backend
Objective: Set up a MySQL database as a backend service and ensure that the data persisted across container restarts.

#Step 3: Deploy Node.js App with Backend MySQL DB using Docker Compose
Objective: Use Docker Compose to link the Node.js app and MySQL database, making it easy to manage the containers together.
